This creates a docker container for building QGIS for android

Usage:
======
From the current directory run
  docker build .


Development:
===========
The Qt SDK installer is a piece of software that only works with a GUI dialog
and that is not what we want it to do here. So you have to do some work in order
to get the SDK into the docker image.

 * Download the latest Qt SDK. Host arch: 64 bit, Target arch: 32 bit
 * Install it locally
   * to /usr/src/qt
   * cd /usr/src/qt
   * tar -zcvf qt5.3.1.tar.bz2 Qt5.3.1
